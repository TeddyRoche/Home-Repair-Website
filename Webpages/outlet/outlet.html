        <p class="intro-para">
            First you need to figure out what type of outlet your need.<br> 
            Below are a few common types you can find in your house:
        </p>
        <div class="title-grid">
            <h2>Duplex</h2>
            <h2>GFCI</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="outlet-desc-1">
            <p>A common electrical receptacle featuring two side-by-side sockets for 
                connecting two devices simultaneously. Found in homes and businesses, 
                it provides easy access to electrical power, accommodating a variety of 
                appliances and devices. Safety features may include tamper resistance and 
                Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) protection.</p>
            <p>A safety device designed to protect against electrical shocks. GFCIs monitor 
                the flow of electrical current and quickly cut power if they detect 
                imbalances, which could indicate a ground fault. They are commonly found 
                in areas where water is present, like bathrooms, kitchens, and outdoor 
                outlets, ensuring electrical safety in potentially hazardous locations.</p>
            <p>A safety device designed to prevent electrical fires. AFCIs monitor 
                electrical circuits for abnormal arcing, which can create sparks and 
                ignite fires. If they detect dangerous arc faults, AFCIs swiftly cut 
                power to prevent potential fire hazards. They are typically used in 
                bedrooms and living spaces to enhance electrical safety.</p>
            <p>A specialized electrical receptacle equipped with built-in USB ports, 
                designed for directly charging electronic devices without the need for 
                a separate adapter. USB outlets are a convenient addition to homes and 
                public spaces, offering a streamlined way to power smartphones, tablets, 
                and other USB-powered gadgets while freeing up standard outlets for other 
                uses.</p>

        <div class="outlet-desc-3">
            <p>specialized electrical outlet for electric stoves and ovens. Typically 
                rated at 240 volts with 40 or 50 amperes, it provides the high power 
                needed for cooking appliances. Range outlets have distinctive 
                configurations, including three or four prong slots, for safety and 
                proper voltage supply.
            </p>
            <p>Designed for electric clothes dryers, this outlet is rated at 240 volts 
                and 30 amperes, accommodating the heating element's power requirements. 
                Like range outlets, dryer outlets have either three or four prong slots, 
                ensuring safe and efficient electrical connections.</p>
            <p>
                Two-prong outlets are characterized by their two slots, typically one 
                narrower and one wider. They lack a grounding slot, which means they do 
                not provide a dedicated path for excess electrical current to safely 
                dissipate in the event of a fault or short circuit. This absence of
                 grounding can increase the risk of electrical shock. Two-prong outlets 
                 are often found in older homes built before modern electrical codes 
                 required grounded outlets, and they are considered less safe than their 
                 three-prong counterparts.
            </p>
            <p>Three-prong outlets have three slots: two vertical slots for prongs 
                (hot and neutral) and a semi-rounded grounding slot. This additional 
                grounding slot allows for a dedicated path to ground excess electrical 
                current, significantly enhancing safety. The presence of grounding reduces 
                the risk of electrical shock and helps prevent electrical fires. 
                Three-prong outlets are the modern standard in residential and commercial 
                electrical systems, complying with current building codes and safety 
                requirements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="outlet-desc-2">
            <p>The amperage rating of an outlet should match the amperage rating of the 
                circuit it's connected to. Using a 20-amp outlet on a 15-amp circuit is 
                generally acceptable, but using a 15-amp outlet on a 20-amp circuit is not 
                safe.
                <br>
                When installing or replacing outlets, it's crucial to adhere to local 
                electrical codes and safety guidelines to ensure proper and safe electrical 
                connections for your specific needs.</p>
